# PicoPiusbMidiHostDevice
A MIDI host and device using Pico Pi and PIO USB   

Uses code adopted from: https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb   
And the SSD 1306 library from: https://github.com/daschr/pico-ssd1306   
And relies on the code from there, which is in the TinyUSB library: https://github.com/sekigon-gonnoc/Pico-PIO-USB   

Creates a MIDI device via the main USB port, and a MIDI host using Pico-PIO-USB.   
The PIO USB is attached to GPIO 6 (pin 9) and GPIO 7 (pin 10)   
The SSD 1306 is attached to GPIO 2 (pin 4) and GPIO 3 (pin 5)  
There is also a serial output on GPIO 0 (pin 1)
